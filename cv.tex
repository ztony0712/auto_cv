\textbf{Feature Fusion Based on Mutual-Cross-Attention Mechanism for EEG Emotion Recognition} \\ % Project title
\textit{National Natural Science Foundation of China, Singapore} \hfill Dec. 2023 | Mar. 2024
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proposed a purely mathematical MCA which fuse two features more effectively; developed a unique Channel-Frequency-Time 3D feature structure, which presents spectral and temporal information simultaneously. 
    \item Published to Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention -- MICCAI 2024.

\noindent
\textbf{Motion Planning Simulation for Autonomous Driving} \\ % Project title
\textit{Master Thesis: Final Project Report, Singapore} \hfill Oct. 2023 | Apr. 2024 % Project affiliation and location
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulated and visualized four advanced planners using the unified dataset and simulator provided by nuplan-devkit; created an evaluation score benchmark for comparison and analysis.
    \item Designed a novel learning-based planner based on diffusion model; simulated and evaluated the new planner for comparing with the benchmark.

\textbf{Emotion Judgment System Based on Deep Learning and EEG Analysis} \\ % Project title
\textit{National Student Research Training Program, China} \hfill May. 2021 | May. 2022 % Position and duration
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pre-processed DEAP dataset through band-pass filter and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) by using Python MNE package library.
    \item Extracted wavelet coefficients using the db4 wavelet of the continuous wavelet decomposition; generate 'scale' (64) dimension from frequency (128 Hz) dimension (Nyquist rate); calculated average energy to Shannon entropy ratio (EER) for each scale; selected appropriate ranges of scale to calculate.
    \item Built a novel four-classifier by merging bi-classifier; experimented and filtered the eight dominate channels with the most prominent emotional response to enhance model performance.
    % Job responsibilities and achievements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Design and fabrication of a brain-controlled rolling robot based on OpenBCI-Python-Arduino} \\ % Project title
\textit{Provincial Student Research Training Program, China} \hfill Jun. 2020 | May. 2021 % Position and duration
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and programmed a simple 'admissible heuristic' by utilizing RNN in TensorFlow.
    \item Pre-processed EEG data using NeuroPype to remove noise; extracted feature through the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP); employed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as classifier.
    \item Designed and developed a novel 'Disk' human-computer interaction interface by PyQt of Python. The output of the classifier indirectly controlled the robot by switching 'gears' on the 'Disk' that represent different motion states.
    \item Published to International Conference on Electronics Technology (ICET), 2022.
